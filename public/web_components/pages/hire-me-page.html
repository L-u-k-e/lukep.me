						You've probably landed on this page because you want some help turning an idea into a reality. Maybe your an individual or maybe you're recruiting on behalf of a larger company. Maybe your idea is just taking off, maybe its already manifested into a full-fledged product or maybe it's still in conception.
					</p>
					<p>
						This page is here to act as a screen, to give you an idea of whether or not my skills can be of service to you.
					</p>

					<p>	  
						I believe I bring a unique blend of problem solving skills and appreciation for the user's experience that other developers aren't typically able to cultivate. I have fallen in love with coding. It's a flow state activity that allows me to excercise my mind. More than that though, to me, a programming language serves as a medium of <em>creation</em>. I study my medium and I love it, I am forever driven to make the code that I produce clean, maintainable, scaleable and beautiful. At the core of my passion, however, is the knowledge that with enough work, programming is a medium that can turn thoughts and ideas into actual value: real products that can demonstrate influence over the malleable world we let them loose in. This marraige of creating something great and <em>doing it right</em> is what drives me. It is my vision and it is my love. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This vision facilitates the creation of products that sit on a higher caliber than most people are willing to put in the work to create. Put simply, I take pride in my work.  
					</p>

						Now that you've got an idea of what i'm all about, lets find out if my skills can help you fufill your dreams. 
					</p>
					<p>
						First of all, if you're just looking for a single developer to help you build or improve your website in some way, then check out my web-development page. I go into more detail about the specific services that I offer there. 
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're looking to build something bigger, let me list some of my interests, then you can decide if it's worth meeting up with me in person:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I am interested in working on the application layer. Although systems-level programming intrigues me, it's not the direction I'm looking to take at the moment. (That's not to say I can't drop down to C when the performance is necessary)
						</li>
						<li>
							Money talks, but what drives me farther is the ability to work towards something I can take pride in, so being a part of a team that is building something interesting or meaningful is important to me. 
						</li>
						<li>
							I really enjoy working with the web. It's not going away any time <em>ever</em> and, as a platform, it's becoming stronger and stronger each year.
						</li>
						<li>
							In regards to working on the back-end vs the front-end, I honestly enjoy working on both. This is something that's context sensitive, so we'd have to discuss specifics to see where I could be of the most value.  
						</li>
					</ul>
